################### Currency ID?  ################## 

each currency needs a form of id. 


this id is the form of a hash string/ hash code


hash strings are generated via certain encryption algorithms


by choosing appropriate components such as date, time, data, previous coin hash string etc... 


that will be needed in the encryption, this causes the generated hash strings to be unique 



################## How are currencies validated? ################## 



each currency is in a block. this block contains details such as the current currency hash string and previous currency hash string. 


imagine engraving details on a real coin.


there would need to be some form of storage for the coins


the storage can be a list that contains all previous coins


by comparing a new list with the current one, you can compare value by value in terms of hash strings to determine if the new list is legit



################## how are new coins generated? ################## 


the term is to MINE coins


mining coins is the process of trial and error by inputing values into the components which make up the whole coin


in order to reach an acceptable hash string


an acceptable hash string is determined by the creator


the creator will choose a format that says if a hash string (coin id) matches this format then, it will recognise this as a valid mined coin


and allow it to be added to the list of coins


the reason why its hard is because the acceptable format changes every time a new coin is mined


and since the encryption algorithm is so strong and complex, 


trial and error in order to produce a result which matches the acceptable format is very expensive
